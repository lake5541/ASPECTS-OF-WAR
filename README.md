# ASPECTS OF WAR FOR FALLOUT 3
THE NEW IDEAL GOAL OF THIS GAME IS TO PROVIDE A SHORT WAR INCLUDING ABOUT 1000 ACTORS
WHO CAN FOLLOW THEIR OWN GOALS. THEY FIND STUFF. THEY PATROL NOW. THEY ATTACK SOMETHING
NEW ONCE A DAY. YOU GET A REALLY COOL PISTOL AND SOME ARMOR BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO DO MOST OF
THE WORK ON YOUR OWN DURRING THE MAIN SILENT QUEST. I CAN NOT REMEMBER IF I GAVE YOU
AMERICAN SOLDIERS OR NOT. YOU MIGHT HAVE TO BRING YOUR OWN. ITS A WAR GAME. 

TYPE COC MEGATON01 FROM THE CONSOLE TO START FROM THE MAIN MENU. I DIDNT DO A START QUEST
FOR A GOOD REASON. IT CAUSED MORE PROBLEMS THEN IT SOLVED. SO THAT GOT AXED. 
WORK ON THIS PROJECT HAS HALTED AT NEXUSMODS AND MODDB
ALL FUTURE WORK WILL BE POSTED ONLY AT GITHUB. THANK YOU
